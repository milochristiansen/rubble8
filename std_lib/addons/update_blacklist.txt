# Auto-Update Blacklist File.
# 
# Any addon packs listed here will be blocked from auto-updating.
# 
# Use this to prevent Rubble from updating your addons if you want
# to use old versions for some reason.
# 
# Another use of this file is to prevent Rubble from trying to look
# for updates when offline (so addons load faster).
# 
# To add an addon pack to this list simply place it's name on a line
# by itself. If the addon pack file is "XYZ.zip" then you should list
# "XYZ" here.
