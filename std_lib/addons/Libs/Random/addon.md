Generally it is possible to regenerate a world that uses this addon *so long as you use the same seed*!

If you used "auto seed" when initially generating the world **do not use it when regenerating** instead
use the seed supplied by the world's config variable dump.

In any case if you use any addons that are clients of this one, make *extra* sure to make a backup
before trying to regenerate!

This kind of thing is one of the (many) reasons that regenerating is discouraged.
