I finally bought a new monitor, 1920x1080 is just a *little* different from 1280x1024 :P

Needless to say larger screen means I need a larger tileset...

This is a version of my 16x16 tileset redrawn to be 24x24. Instead of making a pure ASCII
version to use as a text sheet I am using a 24x16 font I had flying around.

Unlike the 16x16 version this includes basic support for TWBT Next. While may tiles are properly
masked, you probably won't notice any difference in most cases (they should look different with
engraved floors though). Tiles that have color (levers mostly) have proper overlays, but once
again the difference is minimal.

Fun fact for the day: Bit-map fonts cannot be copyrighted, odd...
Anyway I am not sure if most of these sheets can really be considered a font anymore, if not just 
think of them as being CC0 :)
