This is a version of my personal tileset made to work with the Text Will Be Text DFHack plugin.
Most of the graphics have been redrawn to use finer lines and/or a little gray to provide a mild 3D 
effect, if you dislike this feel free to replace any tiles you wish with better versions :)

I am not completely done with this, as I would like to override the tiles used for all the buildings
as well as a few more item tiles, maybe someday...

* MLC 16x16 - Font.png
	* This tilesheet is perfectly ASCII, no graphical tiles at all.
	* Used for text.

* MLC 16x16 - Graphics.png
	* This tilesheet has a few graphical tiles, but mostly it is the same as the font sheet.
	* Default tiles for the game view.

* MLC 16x16 - Overrides.png
	* This sheet contains all the override tiles, eg all the specific graphics.
	* Override tiles for the game view.

* The basic font is a hand resized version of the CLA 18x18 font
* The track tiles are cleaned up and simplified versions of the ones from the SpaceFox tileset
* A few of the graphical tiles are redrawn from various other tilesets, mostly I just used the outlines.

Fun fact for the day: Bit-map fonts cannot be copyrighted, odd...
Anyway I am not sure if most of these sheets can really be considered a font anymore, if not just 
think of them as being CC0 :)
