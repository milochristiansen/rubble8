This version is very close to default ASCII (a few tiles are graphical).

Comes in two sizes, a 16x16 for fullscreen mode and a 10x10 for windowed mode.

The 16x16 tilesheet:

The 10x10 tilesheet:

![10x10 tilesheet](/addonfile?addon=Tilesets/MLC/Normal&file=MLC%2010x10.tset.png)

This addon makes no raw changes, so it should be usable with all ASCII compatible mods.
