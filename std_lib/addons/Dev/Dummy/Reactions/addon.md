By default 15 reactions are created, if you want a different number of reactions to be generated set 
the `DEV_DUMMY_REACTION_COUNT` config variable.

This addon is only useful if you do some modding and want to be able to hack new stuff into a world
in progress with minimum fuss.

These reactions are empty by default, use if you want to add new content after worldgen.
