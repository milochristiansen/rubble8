By default 5 workshops and 5 furnaces are created, if you want to change the number generated set
the `DEV_DUMMY_WSHOPS_COUNT` and `DEV_DUMMY_WSHOPS_FURNACE_COUNT` config variables.

This addon is only useful if you do some modding and want to be able to hack new stuff into a world
in progress with minimum fuss.

These workshops and furnaces are empty by default, use if you want to add new content after worldgen.
