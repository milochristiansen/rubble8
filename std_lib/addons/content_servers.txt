# This file contain a list of all content servers known to me at the moment I packed this version for distribution.
# 
# To add more servers simply place the address of each one on a line by itself.

# Uncomment the next line if you are running a test server on local host.
#127.0.0.1:2220

# No global servers known. Can you host one?
# 
# If you want to host a content server, contact me for a dedicated server binary
# and instructions for it's use. The dedicated server is statically compiled and
# self-contained, all you need to do is drop it into a directory and start it.
# 64 or 32 bit x86 (and in some cases, ARM) Linux, OSX, Windows, Solaris, Plan9,
# FreeBSD, etc binaries are all available on request. If your server runs it, I
# can probably build a binary for it.
