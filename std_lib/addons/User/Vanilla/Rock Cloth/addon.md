Mine chrysotile and extract asbestos strands from it, these strands can be used to make asbestos
cloth in the same basic way you would make adamantine cloth.

Chrysotile is found as small clusters in olivine deposits.

Based on raws by Bay12 forums user "Tomsod", from a suggestion by user "SixOfSpades".
See [this thread](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=145613.0) for details.

Contrary to popular belief chrysotile is fairly safe, so long as you take precautions not to breath
it or eat it. Chrysotile has better fibers than most forms of asbestos, which makes it much safer to
handle (because it is less likely to produce lots of "dust" or small bits of asbestos fiber), with
proper care it is perfectly safe.

Most of asbestos' bad reputation was caused by two things: prolific use of cheaper "brown asbestos",
which is much more difficult to handle safely (it has smaller, more fragile, fibers) and lack of proper
handling, leading to health problems (cancer) caused by breathing or ingesting asbestos fiber fragments.

Anyway, if you are one of the hysterical nut jobs who insist all asbestos is evil I don't want to
hear about it, just pretend that dwarves use their beards as respirators or something.
