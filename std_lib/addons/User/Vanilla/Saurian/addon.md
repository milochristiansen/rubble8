Saurians are a small (size 20000) reptilian race of swamp dwellers with mildly venomous bites
(causes pain).

Saurians cannot dig at embark, but if a pick were to be bought (and resized to fit smaller hands)
digging, even down to the magma sea and below, should be possible.

Saurians are very warlike, most times civilians will charge into combat as readily as the military.
This can cause some problems unless you outfit your civilians with at least basic armor and weapons,
but it also means that weak enemies tend to get swarmed under and killed quickly (where dwarves
would spend too much time trying to run away an so would take more casualties).

While saurians are not very tough, they are FAST and can quickly run down and kill foes many times 
their size with the proper equipment and training, often before the enemy can get a blow in. Of course 
if the enemy CAN get a blow in the saurian is often in trouble!

In keeping with their small size and speed saurian armor tends to be tough and light.

While saurians can dig just like dwarves, they cannot make picks. This means that if you want to do any 
mining you will need to buy a pick from the dwarves or humans. 
Don't plan on doing any digging until late in the second or third year (or even later). 
When you do finally get a pick you will find that saurians learn the mining skill VERY slowly, so don't 
plan on having a huge underground fortress.
This tends to make a sawmill critical to your early survival, as you will need lots of wood blocks 
and/or charcoal depending on whether you want to build your fort out of masonry, glass, or wood blocks. 
Clay for pottery may be difficult to get without digging, use a quarry to ensure your supply.

You will not get a caravan until spring of the second year! This may make difficult embarks a
little more Fun.

If you do not want to divert pottery/carpentry capacity to making furniture, wicker can make a good 
replacement so long as you can gather/grow enough plants, plus if you use bins, wicker is a perfect
bin material as it is really light.

All saurians have natural skill (level 2) in bite, kick, punch, and fighter.

This addon only includes the saurian creature and entity as well as saurian sized weapons and some 
basic reactions. Nothing else is included.

If you need mechanisms (for levers and such) the `addon:User/Bonecarver` addon allows you to make them
from bone and the `addon:User/Wooden Mechanisms` addon allows them to be made from wood. If you would
prefer the `addon:User/Pottery` and `addon:User/Pottery/Batch` addons allows you to fire clay
mechanisms instead.

It is HIGHLY recommended to activate at least the `addon:User/Quarry`, `addon:User/Sawmill`,
`addon:User/Warcrafter` and `addon:User/Pottery` addons (the `addon:User/Glass Forge` addon
is required).

To dig as saurians you need to buy a pick and resize it at the craftsaurian.

If this addon is activated dwarves are unplayable and the dwarven outpost liaison becomes a trade rep 
(unless you set saurians unplayable via the provided config var).

Tips:

* Use hunters.
	
	Saurians are good hunters and so long as your arrows hold out you can get large amounts of good 
	cheap food without having to worry about diverting farm space. The other animal products gathered 
	are just as valuable, leather is one of the components for the better armor materials and bone 
	makes a good source of hunting/training arrows. In late/mid game hunters can become valuable 
	additions to your military as snipers.

* Pay attention to your saurian's castes.
	
	You can of course just assign anyone to anything but if you try to make sure you match jobs to 
	caste bonuses you can get that extra little bit of performance that can sometimes make a big 
	difference. For example shaman caste saurians make good support troops or doctors but would be 
	wasted as farmers or crafters.

* Sawmill!
	
	You almost *need* a sawmill. It is possible to do without, but things will be much harder. The
	sawmill will be your main source of building material one way or another, either building directly
	with wood blocks or making charcoal for glass blocks and fired bricks.

* Embark with supplies for glass making.
	
	Sand is, *ahem*, cheap as dirt, so take a LOT. All those bags come in handy later and the more stuff
	you can make before needing to tie up your haulers filling bags the better. Also take some charcoal.
	Getting a large serrated disk for a sawmill is number 1 priority for most embarks, and not needing
	to wait for charcoal to be made can speed things up measurably.

* Use glass!
	
	On most maps glass will make a good, renewable, source of valuable and useful goods. Glass can also 
	be made into rather good weapons and armor (crystal glass is almost as good as steel and clear 
	glass is just as good as iron).

* Buy rare items like gems, silk and stone ASAP (unless you like failed moods).
	
	If you need raw gems you can "uncut" large gems you trade for at the craftsaurian's workshop, if 
	you need cut gems you can use glass. Stone boulders can be pressed from blocks at the 
	craftsaurian's workshop, fired from clay at the kiln and batch kiln, or dug up at a quarry. Silk 
	cloth is (generally) only available from trade, if you get lucky and have some aboveground web 
	vermin in the area pen up the cats!

* Don't forget metal!
	
	It takes a LONG time to train a smith, but for the absolute best weapons and armor there is no 
	substitute for steel and adamantine.
	
	One shortcut to keep in mind: If you can train several saurians to be novice armor or weapon smiths 
	you may get a legendary smith from a mood if you wait long enough...
