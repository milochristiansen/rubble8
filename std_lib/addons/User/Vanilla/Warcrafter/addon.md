The warcrafter allows you to make:

* Scalemail armor from leather, bone, and shell
* Bolts and arrows from bone and shell
* Heavy cloaks from leather
* Green glass weapons and armor (if the `addon:User/Glass Forge` addon is active)

Making bone and shell items requires you to cut them into "scales" first.
