Gnomes are a small (size 15000) race of artisans and engineers

Gnomes are better with stone than dwarves, learning most stone working skills far faster than the
average dwarf (and they are not half bad with metal either!). Unfortunately gnomes are poor warriors,
as they are too small and weak to stand up to most enemies. 

Most gnomes use their special geared crossbows if they are forced to fight, but some braver gnomes
may use other weapons as well. Most gnomish fighters sharpen the points of their crossbow's gears,
giving them an axe-like raking attack that gives them a better chance of standing off an enemy if
they run short on darts. Most other gnome weapons have also benefited from gnome ingenuity, ranging
from the power hammer to the spring spear (as no self-respecting gnome would fight with a simple
hunk of sharp metal like a human).

Gnomes really shine when the time comes to build something mechanical. As engineers gnomes are
unparalleled, and there is nothing a gnome likes better than making a machine that is twice as
complicated as it needs to be...

Gnomes are less dependent on alcohol than dwarves, but they still prefer it to water.

No gnome would be caught dead using anything from the surface that could be gotten from underground,
so surface wood, plants, etc are not available from embark (underground wood is available). Sadly
due to game limitations surface animals are available.

It is *highly* recommended to activate the powered workshop addons!
These addons may as well be purpose made for gnome mode.
