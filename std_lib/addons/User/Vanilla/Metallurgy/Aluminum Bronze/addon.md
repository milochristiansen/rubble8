My source for the material data did not say how the material compares to other weapons
grade metals, but supposedly the numbers where generated based on the real material.

WARNING! This metal may be wildly unbalanced!
I am not sure, but some of the material values make it look like this stuff may be as
good or better than steel in some categories!

IRL aluminum bronze is a good bit better than normal bronzes, being very corrosion
resistant and (due to it's copper content) resistant to marine growths as well as being
at least a little stronger (I'm not sure how much). Due to it's pretty silvery gold color
aluminum bronze is sometimes used in jewelry and other decorative applications (although
it is relatively cheap)

In any case aluminum bronze should make fine weapons and armor and is quite
valuable (slightly more than half as valuable as pure aluminum).

A good material for armoring your nobles!
