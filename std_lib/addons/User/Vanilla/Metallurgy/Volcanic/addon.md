Made from a mix of metals carefully steeped in specially prepared magma, volcanic metal has some very 
odd properties. Volcanic metal is always slightly warm to the touch and is very heavy, it is also far 
stronger than its components. 

Volcanic metal is made from platinum and iron in roughly equal parts (plus lots of magma).

Note that this reaction is only possible at the magma version of the alloy furnace and that it
USES UP 4/7 magma!
