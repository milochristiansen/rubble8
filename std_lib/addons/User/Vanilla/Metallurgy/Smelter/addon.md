Replaces the default ore smelting reactions with a better set.

Unfortunately this addon completely breaks the metal ore embark indicator and stockpiles
(use economic stone stockpiles instead).

Galena and tetrahedrite may only be smelted to one metal at a time, so you need to decide which
metal is more important to your needs.
