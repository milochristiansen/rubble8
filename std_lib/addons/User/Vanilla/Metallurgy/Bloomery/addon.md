This completely replaces vanilla iron and steel production.

Sadly this required removing the metal ore tags from iron ores (which breaks the metal ore embark 
indicator and ore stockpiles).

This addon is loosely based on parts of the Realistic 14th Century Metallurgy Mod.

To refine iron or make steel you need to make a bloom and hammer impurities out of it multiple times, 
if you have flux you can cut the time required in half and save some fuel (by skipping the first two 
hammer steps). The bloomery uses flux *blocks* not boulders, as the process does not require much flux.

Blooms will self destruct in a few weeks, so you need to keep on top of the process.

Cost Table:

* Iron ore -> 4 bars (no flux): 4.25 fuel per bar, 0 with magma, 4.25 steps per bar
* Iron ore -> 4 bars (with flux): 2.25 fuel per bar, 0 with magma, 2.25 steps per bar
* Iron bar -> steel bar (no flux): 6 fuel per bar, 1 with magma, 5 steps per bar
* Iron bar -> steel bar (with flux): 4 fuel per bar, 1 with magma, 3 steps per bar

For consistency I suggest using this addon together with `addon:User/Metallurgy/Smelter`.
