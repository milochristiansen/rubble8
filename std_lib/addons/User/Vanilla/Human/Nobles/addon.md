Currently the nobles are mostly the same as the dwarven ones. The differences lie mostly in name
(and sometimes not even that).

Some exceptions:

* The manager and bookkeeper are combined into a single "clerk", but you can appoint as many as you want.
* The military and justice nobles are combined, now you just get a guard captain, and he leads a
  squad of 5 elite guards. The guard captain is needed to appoint guard lieutenants, the leaders of
  your military squads. This is done so that you cannot just avoid the whole justice system like you
  can in dwarf mode (unless you want to do without a military). Guard lieutenants do not worry about
  justice, so it is still possible to have your law enforcers equipped with less deadly weapons.
* The hammerer is now a headsman and uses an axe (so instead of addy whiffle bats you may want some
  wooden training axes...).
* The chief medical dwarf is now simply a "medic" and you can appoint as many as you like.
