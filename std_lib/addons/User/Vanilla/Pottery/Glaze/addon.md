Allows you to grind minerals and ores into glaze powders of various colors and then use these powders 
to glaze various items. Unlike vanilla there is not a glazing reaction for each item type, use 
stockpiles to restrict item usage.

Each mineral or ore boulder is ground into 10 units of glaze powder, ash bars only produce 3 units.

There are four different kinds of glazing you may do:

* Ash glazing uses one unit of ash to glaze an item, simple and cheap.
* Monochrome glazing uses two units of any color glaze to glaze an item.
* Dichrome glazing uses one unit of white glaze and one unit of any other color to glaze an item, 
* this is more valuable than monochrome and has an additional chance of having bands on the item
* for even more value.
* Polychrome glazing uses one unit of white and one unit each of blue, red, and yellow glaze to glaze 
* an item, like dichrome this adds lots of value and each non-white color has a chance of adding 
* bands. If you get lucky your simple pot could become very valuable!

This addon is a polished and Rubblized port of the old "Expanded Glazes" mod by "NW_Kohaku". This 
version has had the reactions completely reworked as well as a few other balancing changes.
