The powered decorator takes any improvable item and dyes or encrusts it with any powder (dwarven
sugar encrusted table? Sure why not!).

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
