The powered glass furnace can make glass items, just like the normal glass furnace.

Empty bags are placed at one of the outputs, use sorters to separate them from the item stream.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

To operate the powered glass furnace requires adjacent magma or fuel on an input (magma is given priority).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
