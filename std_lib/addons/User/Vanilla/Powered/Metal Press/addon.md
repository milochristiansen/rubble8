The powered metal press takes metal bars and produces all sorts of metal items.

Since the items are pressed no fuel is needed.

To keep things simple no weapons or armor can be made.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
