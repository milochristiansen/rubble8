When powered this machine launches *any* ammo item on it's input(s) in a straight line
over it's outputs.

Due to being a fixed machine the bolts/arrows/darts/etc will always travel in a
relatively straight line, you will need to use several launchers to cover a wide path.

Keeping this fed is a real challenge! I suggest you do not start it until the last
moment. Clever engineers can figure out ways to automate recovery of spent bolts and
reloading (minecarts and conveyor belts anyone?).

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), projectiles are fired
towards an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time.

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
