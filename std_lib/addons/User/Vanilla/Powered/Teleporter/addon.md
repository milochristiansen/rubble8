This (very expensive!) machine will teleport any nearby creature (9x9 area centered on the workshop)
to it's destination, instantly.

The teleporter requires large amounts of power (500, or ~5.6 water wheels), as well as a large
number of special components (tools made at the forge from weapons grade metal).

If the components are not masterwork quality there is a chance that the teleportee will be frightened
by the experience (the creature description says that they were "frightened in an incident"), frequent
use of poor quality teleporters is not conducive to fortress happiness!

Build a pair of these things, one at one end of a long stairwell or hallway, and the other at the
other end. That way any creature that needs to go from one end to the other will be zapped there
instantly, skipping a long trip. In particular building one down at the magma sea and one at the
bottom level of your fortress can make large magma forging operations (without pumping magma up)
quite efficient.

Another good place to put a teleporter is near the fortress main entry (*inside* the defenses!), as
this will greatly speed any surface hauling that needs to be done. Basically any high traffic area
can benefit from a teleporter. The longer the trip, the bigger the benefit.

Most fortresses will only be able to afford a few teleporters, particularly if water power is hard
to come by. Trying to power teleporters with windmills will require **lots** of space!

Be **very** careful not to place teleporters where hostiles can get at them! If hostiles can reach a
teleporter they may teleport into the heart of your fort, right through your defenses!

Also be careful to shut teleporters down during a siege, as your creatures may teleport into danger
otherwise!

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
