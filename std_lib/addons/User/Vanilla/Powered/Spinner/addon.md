The powered spinner takes any thread plant and turns it into thread.

Each plant in the stack is processed individually (so for large stacks this may be
slower than a skilled dwarf with an efficient stockpile/workshop setup).

Seeds are produced (if possible, they will not be created for seedless plants).

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
