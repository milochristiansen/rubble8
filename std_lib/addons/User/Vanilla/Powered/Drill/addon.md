This machine drills holes, then sucks fluids and items up the shaft
(or you can retract the drill and have a shaft that can be used for whatever).

Drilling requires one pipe section per z-level drilled. When you retract the drill
you will get generic "recycled" pipe sections (that are not magma safe!), so don't
waste iron or other valuable metal on drill pipe, use glass or copper.

If you find magma or water it may be pumped to the surface up to 7/7 at a time.
Fluids are dumped into any adjacent hole in the floor, be careful of stairwells!
Pumping fluids requires at least 4/7 fluid below the drill tip.

The drill will also suck up items and creatures, sadly creatures are unlikely to
survive the trip. Non-fluid objects are ejected at an output if possible, or the center
of the drill if there is no output provided. Unlike many workshops it is safe for creatures
to be around an operating drill (provided they do not walk under the drill string when the
suction is on).

The drill has three reactions, one to extend the drill down one tile, one to retract
the drill one tile, and one to toggle the pump suction. All actions require power.
Each z-level deeper you drill requires 10 more power for each action.

The drill can be used to drive pilings for caissons and the like. This can be used for damming a river,
drying a section of sea floor, piercing an aquifer, etc. Anywhere you need watertight vertical walls
just sink a bunch of parallel drill shafts and leave the pipe behind. When you are done the drill can
be used to retract the pipe.

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
