In return for requiring power to run this version of the sawmill uses no
dwarf labor.

Any wood/stone item can be dumped into an input and turned into planks, but logs and
boulders give the best return. Additionally bones may be cut into bone blocks, but
you cannot recycle other bone items.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
