The powered wood furnace takes wooden planks from one side and outputs ash or charcoal
from the other, simple.

The wood furnace is not fast enough to keep up with a sawmill, you will need to use two
furnaces if you want that. For clear glass production I suggest three, two to feed the
kiln ash and fuel and one to feed fuel to the glass furnace. Three is one more than needed
to take the full output of the sawmill, but this will provide the correct ratio of products.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
