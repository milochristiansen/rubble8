The powered assembler takes blocks and produces furniture and tools.

The quality of the mechanisms in this building determines the quality of the product.
Each item costs 3 blocks.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
