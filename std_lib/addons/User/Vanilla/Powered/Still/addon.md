The powered still takes any brew-able plant and produces alcohol (and seeds if needed).

This workshop is invaluable! So long as you keep it supplied it will provide all the alcohol you
could ever need without the hassle of constantly needing to queue up brewing jobs. This is one of
the most useful powered workshops, and it only becomes more useful as your fortress grows.

Take care not to pile too many plants/fruits on the input, as if you have a barrel shortage they may
rot. Use a sorter to limit the number (just one plant/fruit at a time should be good enough).

Barrels are (of course) required.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
