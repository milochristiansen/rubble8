The powered food processor takes any cookable items and makes them into "processed food" (3 ingredients).

To keep things simple a solid ingredient is *not* required, and the ingredients may be in containers.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
