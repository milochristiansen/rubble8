The powered clothier takes cloth or leather and produces clothing and other items.

This addon has not been tested since 40.24!

AFAIK it still works fine, but it will only make clothing for the main fortress race.

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
