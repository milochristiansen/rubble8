Unneeded clothing can be fed in and reduced to cloth for remaking into useful stuff.
Worn clothing has a chance to not produce anything (the more worn the greater the chance).

Leather items can also be recycled, but the chance of getting usable leather is lower
than the chance cloth items.

The cloth quality is never higher than the quality of the item, the item is also bleached
(dye removed).

If you feed in cloth (not items made from cloth, the cloth itself) it will be unraveled
into thread (with, once again, a chance to fail).

Input items MUST be on an input tile (a special one tile workshop), output is placed
beyond an output tile (which is also required). If multiple output tiles are provided
one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Connecting machines must be built AFTER any mechanical workshop!
