The item sensor defaults to a "true" state and changes to "false" only
when the number of adjacent items is greater or equal to the set limit.

Output is by setting the state of a variety of buildings:

* building (true state/false state)
* gear assemblies (engaged/disengaged)
* doors (open/closed)
* hatch covers (open/closed)
* wall and floor grates (open/closed)
* vertical and floor bars (open/closed)
* floodgates (open/closed)
* upright spike traps (extended/retracted)
* bridges (extended/retracted)
* levers (on/off)

Levers in particular have lots of potential, place your logic wherever
it fits best and use a lever to hook it into complicated machines!
