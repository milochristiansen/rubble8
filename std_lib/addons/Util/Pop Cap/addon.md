This addon will take the values you enter (use the config var editor) and creates a DFHack
script that will set the population caps as specified whenever the fortress is loaded.

This will cause DF to completely ignore the setting in the init files (for worlds that use this addon)!

The default values (as loaded from the init files) *should* be automatically restored when the world is unloaded.
